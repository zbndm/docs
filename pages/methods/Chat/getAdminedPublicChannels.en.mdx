# getAdminedPublicChannels 
Get channels/supergroups/geogroups we're admin in. Usually called when the user exceeds the limit for owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, and the user is given the choice to remove one of his channels/supergroups/geogroups.
## Parameters 
```ts 
ctx.telegram.getAdminedPublicChannels(byLocation,checkLimit)
```

| params | type | required | description | 
| :----: | :---: | :-----: | :---------: |
| byLocation | boolean | Optional | Get geogroups. | 
| checkLimit | boolean | Optional | If set and the user has reached the limit of owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, instead of returning the channel list one of the specified errors will be returned. Useful to check if a new public channel can indeed be created, even before asking the user to enter a channel username to use in channels.checkUsername/channels.updateUsername. | 

## Example 
```ts highlight="3"
bot.command("getAdminedPublicChannels",async (ctx) => {
    if(!ctx.chat.private){
        let results = await ctx.telegram.getAdminedPublicChannels()
        console.log(results)
    }
})
```
