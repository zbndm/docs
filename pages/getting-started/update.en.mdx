# Handle Update

## Composer

composer is a class that functions to handle updates. Composer itself can be used to handle files that are different from your index/main file. You can import this Composer from tgsnake and then use it. Read more : [Creating New Composer.](#creating-new-composer)

## handle update using Composer.hears

> Shorthand : Composer.hear

```typescript
Composer.hears(key, ...middlewareFunction)
```

**Key** Is a filter used to filter incoming updates (text messages). if the message matches `key`, the **middlewareFunction** function will be executed.

**middlewareFunction** It is a function that will be executed if **key** is **true**. **middlewareFunction** will give an argument in the form of **[MessageContext](/beta/classes/Context.MessageContext.html)** which we can call **ctx** or **context** which is an update of text message or edit message.

```typescript
// you can also use bot.hears if you don't want to create a new composer.
new_composer.hears("hello", (ctx) => {
  ctx.reply("its work")
})
```

## handle update using Composer.command

> Shorthand : Composer.cmd

```typescript
Composer.command(key, ...middlewareFunction)
```

**Key** Is a filter used to filter incoming updates (text messages with `prefix` (prefix) `.!/`). if the message matches `prefix + key`, the **middlewareFunction** function will be executed. `prefix` only applies when `key` is a `string`.

**middlewareFunction** It is a function that will be executed if **key** is **true**. **middlewareFunction** will give an argument in the form of **[MessageContext](/beta/classes/Context.MessageContext.html)** which we can call **ctx** or **context** which is an update of text message or edit message.

```typescript
// you can also use bot.cmd if you don't want to create a new composer.
new_composer.cmd("hello", (ctx) => {
  ctx.reply("send !hello or .hello or /hello")
})
```

## handle update using Composer.action

```typescript
Composer.action(key, ...middlewareFunction)
```

**Key** Is a filter used to filter incoming updates (callbackQuery). if the data from the callbackQuery matches the key, the **middlewareFunction** function will be executed.

**middlewareFunction** It is a function that will be executed if **key** is **true**. **middlewareFunction** this will give an argument as **[UpdateBotCallbackQuery](/beta/classes/Updates.UpdateInlineBotCallbackQuery.html) | [UpdateBotInlineCallbackQuery](/beta/classes/Updates.UpdateBotCallbackQuery.html)** which we can call **ctx** or **context**.

```typescript
// you can also use bot.action if you don't want to create a new composer.
new_composer.action("click", (ctx) => {
  ctx.reply("clicked")
})
```

## handle update using Composer.inlineQuery

```typescript
Composer.inlineQuery(key, ...middlewareFunction)
```

**Key** Is a filter that is used to filter incoming updates (inlineQuery). if the query from inlineQuery matches the key, then the **middlewareFunction** function will be executed.

**middlewareFunction** It is a function that will be executed if **key** is **true**. **middlewareFunction** will give an argument in the form of **[UpdateBotInlineQuery](/beta/classes/Updates.UpdateBotInlineQuery.html)** which we can call **ctx** or **context**.

```typescript
// you can also use bot.inlineQuery if you don't want to create a new composer.
new_composer.inlineQuery("search", (ctx) => {
  console.log(ctx)
})
```

## handle update using Composer.on

> [See also all available keys.](/beta/interfaces/Update.Context)

```typescript
Composer.on(key, ...middlewareFunction)
```

**Key** Is a filter that is used to filter incoming updates. if the update matches the key, then the **middlewareFunction** function will be executed.

**middlewareFunction** It is a function that will be executed if **key** is **true**. **middlewareFunction** this will give an argument in the form of **[TypeUpdate](/beta/modules/Updates#TypeUpdate)** which we can call **ctx** or **context**.

```typescript
// you can also use bot.on if you don't want to create a new composer.
new_composer.on("message", (ctx) => {
  console.log(ctx)
})
```

## Middleware Function (Composer.use)

```typescript
Composer.use(...middlewareFunction)
```

This function will be executed first before some of the above handlers.

```plain-text
// on new event
[ UPDATE FROM TELEGRAM ] -> [ TGSNAKE ] -> [ MIDDLEWARE ] -> [ EVENT HANDLER ]
// after receive the event and you doing something like sendMessage
[ EVENT HANDLER ] -> [ TGSNAKE ] -> [ TELEGRAM ]
```

Contoh penggunaan middleware secara sederhana

```typescript
// you can also use bot.use if you don't want to create a new composer.
Composer.use((ctx, next) => {
  console.log(ctx)
  return next() // you have to run the next function for the event handler to work, otherwise it will stop here.
})
```

## Creating New Composer

<TabGroup>
  <TabContent name="typescript">

```typescript
// index.ts
// import the composer first from tgsnake.
import { Composer, Snake } from 'tgsnake';
//      ^^^^^^^^
// You have successfully imported, the next step is to create a new composer
const new_composer = new Composer();
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
// You can rename with anything.
const bot = new Snake();
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Make sure you already have a client.
bot.use(new_composer.middleware());
//      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Running the Composer using middleware. Well this is a required part to make a composer work.
bot.run();

```

  </TabContent>
  <TabContent name="javascript">

```typescript
// index.js
// import the composer first from tgsnake.
const { Composer, Snake } = required('tgsnake');
//      ^^^^^^^^
// You have successfully imported, the next step is to create a new composer
const new_composer = new Composer();
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
// You can rename with anything.
const bot = new Snake();
//    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Make sure you already have a client.
bot.use(new_composer.middleware());
//      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Running the Composer using middleware. Well this is a required part to make a composer work.
bot.run();
