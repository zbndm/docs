# Start from zero

Hi! Do you want to make telegram bot with mtproto in javascript or typescript? If yes tgsnake is the best framework for you. Briefly, tgsnake is an mtproto framework that uses gramjs as its base. We have simplified the raw Api from gramjs into a simple and easy to understand method.

## Getting ApiHash and ApiId

Where can I find the apiHash and apiId?

You can find it from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). You must create a apps in there. Warning! Don't share your ApiHash and ApiId!

## After create apps

After create apps you create a project in your computers. Then install `tgsnake` framework.

1. `mkdir tgsnake-project`
2. `cd tgsnake-project`
3. `npm init -y`
4. `npm i tgsnake --save`
5. `code .`

Then create `index.js` file and start writing the code. for example code you can see in [first page](/). Then running your code.

## How to generate stringSession?

For generating string session you can use [this website](/login) or `Snake.save()` when client is running.

```typescript
const { Snake } = require("snake")
const bot = new Snake()
bot.run()
bot.on("connected", () => bot.save())
```
